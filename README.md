# Guide-to-Data-Analysis-using-Python--IMDB-movies-data

Welcome to the IMDB Top 30 Movies Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of the top 30 movies on IMDB using Python. The goal of this project is to extract insights and trends from the dataset, visualising various aspects such as ratings, genres, release years, and more. Some of the areas that are analysed include genre distribution, average rating (IMDB / metascore), profit vs budget, 

Introduction
This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of the top 30 movies as rated by IMDB users. By using Python and various data analysis libraries, we aim to uncover interesting patterns and insights within the data. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualisation, and some basic statistical analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following information for each of the top 30 movies:

- Title
- Year of release
- Genre(s)
- Director
- IMDB rating
- Number of votes
- Duration
- Budget

Python Libraries:
- numpy
<br>Purpose: numpy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.
Usage: Although not explicitly used in the provided code snippet, numpy is often used for numerical operations and manipulation of data arrays.

- pandas
<br>Purpose: pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series that are useful for handling structured data.
<br>Usage:
Reading data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

- seaborn
<br>Purpose: seaborn is a statistical data visualisation library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
<br>Usage: seaborn is typically used for creating complex visualisations such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps with ease. In this project, it might be used for visualising distributions and relationships in the data.

- matplotlib
<br>Purpose: matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations in Python. It is highly customisable and supports a wide range of plot types.
<br>Usage: Plotting data. Creating various plots like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.

<br>Using Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in a web-based interface. It is particularly useful for data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualisation. 
Visualisations and outputs from code cells are displayed directly below the code cells. This interactive feedback allows you to iteratively refine your analysis and visualisations.

By leveraging Jupyter Notebook along with these libraries, you can perform a thorough and interactive analysis of the IMDB Top 30 Movies dataset, gaining insights and visualising trends effectively.
